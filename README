This cli is still in BETA version. I am constantly working on improving it.

It basically does all of the leg work that is related working with cURL and getting the API tool responces. 
With this cli you do not need to know the exact syntax. It will do it all for you.

I recommend running it from the Cloud Server rather than a normal server. Running from the Cloud Server will allow you 
to login to DBaaS MySQL server instance as well. All the MySQL access from elswhere is blocked.


I will be modifying the look and description of the available options so it would be easier to read.

Once downloaded, run ./API_TOOL.sh

You will be prompted to enter the following:

USERNAME account_username
RACKSPACE ACCOUNT NUMBER/DDI account_number
API KEY (PROVIDED BY RACKSPACE WHEN THE ACCOUNT IS CREATED) api_key

DataCenter Location: 
1 LON
2 DFW
3 ORD


(whichever location your account server is based in. All of the UK Cloud customers are located in LON DC)

	The Menu is looking something like this:


CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:

1 DATABASE INSTANCES
2 MONITORING
3 EXIT
